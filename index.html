        Sharu is build upon <a href="https://ipfs.io" target="_blank">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>,
        RSA, AES and ECC
        crypto. Sharu runs locally as an electron app. There is no backend server.

      <div class="text-block platinum-text justify">
        As your files are distributed via IPFS your machine has to be online to allow others to download your shared
        files.
        To allow sharing with your machine offline, you can setup a pinning server to distribute your files.

        Every Sharu folder is AES-GCM 256 encrypted with secure random Keys. These keys are RSA-OAEP 2048 encrypted.
        Your RSA key is encrypted with the key of an Ethereum Wallet. This key is stored encrypted inside the app, with
        a password you choose.
        The encrypted AES and RSA keys are stored in IPFS, you can export your Ethereum Wallet key anytime as a
        mnemonic. So you can easily log in on different machines.
        Currently we use a <a href="https://kaleido.io/" target="_blank">Kaleido</a> permissioned blockchain, to store
        what is shared
        with who. Transactions are free.

        It is probably easier to list what is already working ;-)
        <br /><br />

        <li>
          Sharing of small files (some MB) is already working quite good.
          Big files do work in LAN, but due to the absence of high bandwith of
          upstream in standard environments it does not spark joy when you
          try to share the last season of game of thrones with your friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Receivers of a share can only download files as long as the publisher
          has her sharu-application running. We plan to release some basic
          image/docker-container/whatever to proxy your content using a
          raspberry pi or something else, but the current implementation is
          even more prebeta than the sharu application itself is.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each share does have exactly one owner, multiple contributors to a
          share is not implemented yet. We already know how to add this feature,
          but as long as we struggle with more fundamental issues we are not
          adding any features.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can export your account to different machines, nevertheless you
          can only edit a share from the sharu-application the share was
          initially created. This is also solveable, but the implementation
          remains untouched as long we have fundamental issues to be solved
        </li>
        <li>
          All files are encrypted and only decryptable by exactly the users you
          want. The file- and foldernames are NOT. Again, solveable - but not at
          the top of our Todo-List.

      FAQ
    </h4>
    <div class="flex-container col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
      <div class="text-block platinum-text justify">
        Q: Is it really decentralized, unstoppable, censorfree as long as you are using
        a permissioned chain like Kaleido? <br />
        A: That's right - it is not! But right now usability is more important - we don't want
        our users to think about transaction-costs and FIAT-to-crypto-conversion.
        Moving to the <i>main-net</i> or something similar is going to happen at some
        point (probably in 2020 with PoS or with some kind of side-chain).
        <br /><br />
        Q: Why is looking up shares and downloading files so slow?<br />
        A1: We are still in the process of crunching numbers and use
        hyper-parameter-optimization to find the right setup of the ipfsd running
        inside the application.<br />
        A2: Although all running Sharu-applications try to relay the meta-data of
        all existing shares, this is still pretty basic and some better concept like
        sharding needs to be implemented.
        <br /><br />
        Q: If you want to attach "trustless" to this, why isn't this opensource?<br />
        A: To be honest: we are full of shame about the
        quality of the code. 2 of the 3 developers of Sharu left the path of
        <i>professional</i> software development several years ago and got in touch
        with typescript and solidity for the first time with this project. <strike>Nevertheless,
        this will be opensource at some point and we would be happy if it is not only the
        three of us spending our free nights working on this thing.</strike> <br/>
        UPDATE: As everybody knows 2/3 of us are very good in doing <i>bad code</i>, we felt 
        there is no real problem. Voila: here is the <a href="https://github.com/sharu-io/desktop" target="_blank">desktop-application</a>
        <br /><br />
        Q: Why don't you use metamask as the integration with the ethereum stack?<br />
        A: At first we did, but we think people don't want to add plugins, create
        wallets and do all the other things cryptonerds like to to. ethers.js works fine right
        now.

      WHAT'S NEXT?

    <div class="flex-container col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
      <div class="text-block platinum-text justify">
        There is TONS of stuff to do, this is a non-exclusive list of things we want to achieve in the future
        <br /><br />
        <li>
          This needs to be opensource. Not only because we believe people do not trust compiled code, but also
          because we cannot bring this thing to its final state with our own free time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stability: it is far from being stable. We spent days of trying to use ipfs right (and played both
          with go-ipfs and js-ipfs) and are totally not happy with the current state
        </li>
        <li>
          Relaying: Of course it is not acceptable that a Sharu-instance needs to run for accessing files - we
          already started working on off-the-shelf pinning services you can add to a local machine
          (running in your basement on a raspberry pi or a NAS) or at a VM/HW at your favourite provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaboration: shares should be writeable by multiple partys.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multi-instance: use your Sharu-account on different machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mobile: at least a read-only-version of the shares you can access should be there for your cellphone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Webonly: we started Sharu as a web-only-application but needed to switch to electron as we could not
          find a userfriendly way to integrate with a locally running IPFS-node. Removing the need to install an
          application is still a nice thing we would like to have
        </li>
        <li>
          OS-Integration: mount shares into your OS the same way as you mount NFS or SMB.
        </li>
        <li>
          Permissioned/Non-permissioned blockchain: using Kaleido gave us a lot of benefits, but this cannot be
          the final state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encryption: there is still some stuff not encrypted: filenames, foldernames, the wallets of the people
          allowed to access a share.
        </li>
        <li>
          Migrateability: Moving away from Kaleido currently means that we create a split-brain and all already
          created content is lost.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transactions: right now the application fires transactions into the blockchain with every single change.
          This is fine with a PoA-chain, but most probably not for something else
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintaining the state: we aren't even sure if using a blockchain to decentralized maintain the state (e.g.:
          mapping shares
          to ipfs) is the right way. Maybe we find something better. ;)
        </li>
